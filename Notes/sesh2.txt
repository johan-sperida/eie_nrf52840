Had to do this first:
git remote add upstream https://github.com/eiefirmware/eie_nrf52840.git



Git Workflow for Future Lessons
In general, a good Git process to follow for EiE is as follows:

Checkout the main branch
Pull any remote changes to your local repo to ensure that the main branch is up-to-date
Create a lesson# branch (e.g. lesson2)
Do all work for that lesson on that branch
Create commits at points where you've achieved a goal/milestone, completed a "substantial" amount of work or other similar marker
At the end of the lesson, push your lesson# branch to GitHub



Learning:
- Git often just copies changes

- If branching, changes only apply to current branch
- git branch <name>
- git checkout <name>
    - allows you to go to that branch
    - type checkout -b <name> make and go
- git merge <name> 
    - merges that branch back to main

- git rebase <name>
    - takes current branch and applies it to <name>

- git clone 
    - clones a repo and makes a remote repo on local device
    - makes a remote branch that keeps track of original repo with fetch
    - main remote is origin/main
    -                <branch/repo>

- git fetch
    - gets commits from the remote repo and updates via the remote branch
    - makes a new branch
    - must merge origin/main to local main

- git Pull
    - fetches and merges the new branch to local main
